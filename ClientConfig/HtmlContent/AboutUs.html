<strong>Jenzabar:</strong><br />
It means "Class of the Best and the Brightest"<br />
<br />
Internet technology has transformed many aspects of our lives, making a 
profound impact on how we teach, learn, communicate, and collaborate. 
Today's students cannot imagine going to college without the World Wide 
Web. Higher education institutions today face the challenge of equipping 
campuses with the latest, best, and most robust electronic systems while 
simultaneously protecting their investments in homegrown or legacy 
systems.<br />
<br />
Staffed by people who understand higher education institutions' needs and 
wants, we provide world-class support and a wide array of services. Jenzabar 
has more than 300 associates located in seven regional offices across the 
United States, and 1,500 satisfied customers across the United States and 
around the world.<br /><br />Jenzabar - the class of the best and the 
brightest. <br />
