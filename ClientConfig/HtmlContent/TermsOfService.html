<p>Client acknowledges and agrees that before any of Client's 
prospective students, full and part time students, faculty, staff, 
administration and other users (each, a "User") may have access to the JICS, 
Client shall ensure that each such User shall have accepted and agreed to 
certain terms of service substantially in the form set forth on Exhibit C 
("Terms of Service"), which Terms of Service may be modified by Jenzabar from 
time to time, in Jenzabar's sole discretion. Client may satisfy its obligations 
under this Section by requiring each new User to accept and agree to the Terms 
of Service when the User first establishes his or her new account with Client. 
Client agrees to maintain accurate records of each User's acceptance of the 
Terms of Service, and to provide such records to Jenzabar upon the expiration or 
termination of this Agreement, and at any time upon Jenzabar's 
request.</p>
